# Kempner Institute Spring 2024 Compute Workshop Supplemental Material

Please see the [Workshop Page](TBD) for more information.

The supplementary material contains files for each run scenario. Below is a list of the folders along with a brief description of their purposes. In all models, we modified the first and the last layers of the ResNet-18 model to fit the CIFAR-10 dataset.


## SLURM Examples

- **SLURM Example 1**:
    - Usefule SLURM commands
    - Test Only Jobs
    - Estimating job efficiency (CPU and Memory)


## GPU Examples

- **GPU Example 1**:
    - Model: ResNet-18
    - Dataset: CIFAR-10
    - Resources: 1 GPU (TBD: Put type)
